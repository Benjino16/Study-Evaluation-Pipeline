  "system_prompt": "For the uploaded research paper answer the following questions. Do not use the internet and base your answer solely on the paper. Take your time and analyze carefully. Include Text, tables and Figure captions to answer. Only report your answers in a csv table (with ; as separator and without header) with the number of the question, the answer (yes/no) and a short quote or a short explanatory text in columns. Use one row for each question. Do not give any additional explanatory text beside the csv table. Remove all escape characters (e.g. \\u) from your response. In your answers 'yes' means the required information is missing or not reported, and 'no' means the required information is fully and explicitly reported.",
  "closing_prompt": "Before answering, verify that all quotes you provide are directly from the research paper and that they correctly support whether information was missing ('yes') or fully reported ('no'). If the quote does not support your classification, reconsider your response.",
  "prompts": [
    "1. If a human population was directly involved in the study, are any of the following missing: disease/problem, age, or sex of the population? Exclude the Introduction section from your assessment. Answer no only if all three pieces of information are reported. If yes, specify what is missing or state if no human population was studied.",
    "2. If an animal experiment was conducted, are any of the following missing: disease/problem, sex, or age of the animals? Answer no only if all three are reported. If yes, specify what is missing or state if no animal experiment was conducted.",
    "3. If a cell or cell line experiment was conducted, are any of the following missing: disease/problem or cell type/cell line details? Only answer no if all information is available and provide a direct quote or paraphrase identifying the cell lines. If yes, specify what is missing or state if no cell experiment was conducted.",
    "4. Does the research paper fail to describe an intervention applied to the study population (including experimental conditions)? If no, specify the intervention.",
    "5. Does the paper fail to state any clear and testable hypotheses? . A testable hypothesis must include: A clear relationship between two or more variables (e.g., 'increased X will lead to decreased Y') and A statement that is falsifiable (i.e., can be proven wrong) and measurable variables with objective data. Do not infer or assume hypotheses based on the general research topic or from the research question. If a clear hypothesis is present, provide the exact quote.",
    "6. Is there no clearly identified outcome that would directly address the hypothesis/research objective? If an outcome is present, provide it.",
    "7a. For each statistical analysis in the results section, tables, or figure captions, is the specific statistical test used missing (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, Chi-square)?",
    "7b. For each statistical analysis in the results section, tables, or figure captions, is the calculated test statistic value missing (e.g., z-value, t-value, F-value, Chi-square value)?",
    "7c. For each statistical analysis in the results section, tables, or figure captions, is the criterion for statistical significance missing (e.g., p-value, confidence interval)?",
    "8. Do the authors fail to acknowledge any limitations or biases beyond general research constraints? Here is an example for a limitation beyond general research constraints: Limitation: The study only used male mice, so the findings might not be generalizable to females. Quote: \"Further research is needed to determine if these results hold true in female subjects.\" If limitations are acknowledged, provide an example quote.",
    "9. Do the authors fail to explicitly state inclusion criteria for individuals, cells, or animals? Look for defined eligibility factors beyond the basic study population description.",
    "10. Do the authors fail to explicitly state exclusion criteria for participants, animals, cells, or controls? This includes omitting predefined removal rules, or stating that no exclusion criteria were used. Look for defined characteristics, diagnoses, or other measurable factors that determined eligibility. Simply stating the study population would count as missing. ",
    "11. Does the paper fail to mention whether animals or participants were randomly assigned/allocated to experimental groups? If randomisation is described, report the method. If not, mention if the design was observational or within-subject.",
    "12. Does the paper fail to explicitly state the exact sample size for each group or condition? Be sure to check Figure Captions and Tables."
