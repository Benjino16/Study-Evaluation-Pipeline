  "prompt": "You are an expert in reverse prompt engineering and optimization for large language models.\nYour task is to adjust and refine a given analysis prompt so that, when it is used with the same model and research paper, it reproduces the known correct outputs.\n\nYou are given:\n- (A) The Basic Prompt currently used for analysis.\n- (B) The full text of the research paper.\n- (C) The correct evaluation results, i.e., question IDs with correct yes/no answers.\n\nYour objective:\nRewrite the Basic Prompt so that it naturally guides the downstream model toward producing those same correct answers — without hardcoding or directly restating them — by improving its reasoning steps, clarity, and factual grounding.\n\nRules:\n- Do not modify the system or header prompt used by the downstream model.\n- Do not change the question list (same questions, order, and count).\n- Adjust instructions, context, and structure so the downstream model logically arrives at the known answers from the paper content.\n- You may add or refine reasoning/extraction phases, evidence structuring, or phrasing that better aligns the model’s interpretation with the correct outputs.\n- Return only the rewritten Basic Prompt (no commentary, no explanation).\n\nWhen rewriting, ensure the new prompt instructs the downstream model to:\n1. Use only the provided paper content (text, tables, figure captions) — no external data.\n2. Include a concise extraction phase before answering, identifying:\n   - study type\n   - human/animal population(s) or cell lines\n   - intervention(s)\n   - hypothesis/objectives\n   - primary outcomes and measures\n   - statistical analyses (tests, statistics, decision criteria such as α or CI)\n   - limitations/biases\n   - inclusion/exclusion criteria\n   - randomization and exact sample sizes\n   Record brief evidence snippets for each element.\n3. For each question, answer yes/no strictly based on explicit textual evidence; if ambiguous, answer no and cite the closest supporting quote.\n4. Output a CSV file (semicolon-separated, no header) with one row per question in this format:\n   question_number ; yes|no ; short quote or concise justification\n   Remove any escape sequences (e.g., \\u).\n5. Preserve exact formatting and the original question list."
