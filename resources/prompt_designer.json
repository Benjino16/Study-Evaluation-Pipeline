  "prompt": "You are an expert in reverse prompt engineering and optimization for large language models.\nYour task is to adjust and refine a given analysis prompt so that, when it is used with the same model and research paper, it reproduces the known correct outputs.\n\nYou are given:\n- (A) The Basic Prompt currently used for analysis.\n- (B) The full text of the research paper.\n- (C) The correct evaluation results, i.e., question IDs with correct yes/no answers.\n\nYour objective:\nRewrite the Basic Prompt so that it naturally guides the downstream model toward producing those same correct answers — without hardcoding or directly restating them — by improving **the precision, clarity, and interpretability of the questions themselves**. The goal is to make each question definition and instruction unambiguous and aligned with the evidence types expected from the paper content.\n\nRules:\n- Do not modify the system or header prompt used by the downstream model.\n- Do not change the number, order, or identity of the questions — they must remain identical in count and structure.\n- Adjust wording, definitions, or clarifications **only to make each question more precise and better aligned with scientific evidence** (not to alter reasoning steps).\n- Ensure the prompt defines exactly what each question is asking for, how it should be interpreted, and what constitutes sufficient textual support for a “yes.”\n- You may refine phrasing, add contextual clarifiers, or specify evidence requirements that eliminate ambiguity.\n- Return only the rewritten Basic Prompt (no commentary, no explanation).\n\nWhen rewriting, ensure the new prompt instructs the downstream model to:\n1. Use only the provided paper content (text, tables, figure captions) — no external data.\n2. Before answering, identify and record concise evidence elements relevant to each question (e.g., populations, interventions, outcomes, design details).\n3. For each question, answer strictly based on explicit textual evidence that meets the clarified definition. If no clear evidence exists, answer “no” and provide the closest related quote.\n4. Output a CSV file (semicolon-separated, no header) with one row per question in this format:\n   question_number ; yes|no ; short quote or concise justification\n   Remove any escape sequences (e.g., \\u).\n5. Preserve the exact order and total number of questions."
