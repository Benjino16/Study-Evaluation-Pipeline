    "system_prompt": "For the uploaded research paper answer the following questions. Do not use the internet and base your answer solely on the paper. Take your time and analyse carefully. Include Text, tables and Figure captions to answer. Only report your answers in a csv table (with ; as separator and without header) with the number of the question, the answer (yes/no) and a short quote or a short explanatory text in columns. Use one row for each question. Do not give any additional explanatory text beside the csv table. Remove all escape characters (e.g. \\u) from your response.",
    "closing_prompt": "Before answering verify that all quotes you give are actually from the research paper. If they are not consider your response.",
    "prompts": [
      "1. If a human population was directly involved in the study, have disease/problem, age, and sex been reported? Do not include the Introduction section in your assessment. Only answer yes if all information is available and provide a direct quote or paraphrase identifying the population. If no, please state what information was missing or whether no human population was investigated.",
      "2. If an animal experiment was conducted have disease/problem, sex, and age of animals been reported? Only answer yes if all information is available and provide a direct quote or paraphrase identifying the animal population. If no, please state what information was missing or whether no animal experiment was conducted.",
      "3. Has a cell or cell line experiment been conducted AND have disease/problem and cell type/cell line details been reported? Only answer yes if all information is available and provide a direct quote or paraphrase identifying the cell lines. If no, please state what information was missing or whether no cell experiments were conducted.",
      "4. Does this research paper explicitly describe an intervention being applied to the study population? This also includes designs with different experimental conditions. If yes, name the intervention.",
      "5. Does the paper state any clear and testable hypotheses? Identify only those hypotheses that are explicitly stated and clearly testable. A testable hypothesis must include: A clear relationship between two or more variables (e.g., 'increased X will lead to decreased Y') and A statement that is falsifiable (i.e., can be proven wrong) and measurable variables with objective data. Do not infer or assume hypotheses based on the general research topic or from the research question. If a clear and testable hypothesis is identified, provide the exact quote from the paper that states this hypothesis.",
      "6. Does the paper clearly identify an outcome that would directly address the hypothesis/research objective question?",
      "7a. Do the authors clearly report the following for each statistical analysis in the results section of the main text, tables, or figure captions: The specific statistical test used (e.g., t-test, ANOVA, Chi-square)?",
      "7b. Do the authors clearly report the following for each statistical analysis in the results section of the main text, tables, or figure captions: The calculated test statistic value (e.g., z-value, t-value, F-value, Chi-square value).",
      "7c. Do the authors clearly report the following for each statistical analysis in the results section of the main text, tables, or figure captions: The criterion used to determine statistical significance (e.g., p-value, confidence interval)? ",
      "8. Did the authors acknowledge any limitations or biases beyond general research constraints? For example : Limitation: The study only used male mice, so the findings might not be generalizable to females. Quote: \"Further research is needed to determine if these results hold true in female subjects.\"",
      "9. Did the authors explicitly state the criteria that individuals, cells, or animals had to meet to be included in the study? This should be more specific than simply stating the study population. Look for defined characteristics, diagnoses, or other measurable factors that determined eligibility.",
      "10. Did the authors explicitly state exclusion criteria for the participants, animals, cells or control groups? This includes removing or not considering specific individuals or samples based on predefined criteria, or explicitly stating that no exclusion criteria were used. Also consider if a lack of inclusion criteria could be interpreted as an exclusion criterion.",
      "11. Does the paper explicitly mention that animals or participants were randomly assigned or allocated to different experimental groups? If yes, report if and what method was used for randomisation. If no, mention if this was an observational study or a within subject design.",
      "12. Does the paper explicitly state the exact sample size for each group or condition in the study? Pay also attention to Figure Captions and Tables for the assessment."
